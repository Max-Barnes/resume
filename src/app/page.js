          <p>
            I'm Max Barnes, and I am a creator at heart. Whether it's
            conceptualizing, creative writing, or figuring out how to make
            day-to-day life easier; I am always driven by the idea of what could
            be. I've cultivated leadership experience and customer service
            skills throughout my career across various industries. However, my
            journey into creating video games as a hobby sparked my fascination
            with coding and its potential to take my ideas and build them into
            anything.{" "}

          <p>
            I transitioned to the tech field because I recognized the growing
            demand for the strong interpersonal soft skills I had developed from
            my customer service background. I excel at collaborating with others
            to solve complex challenges, and I find immense satisfaction in
            overcoming difficult obstacles and driving collective success.
